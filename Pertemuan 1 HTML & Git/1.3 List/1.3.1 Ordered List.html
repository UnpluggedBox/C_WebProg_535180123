    <h1>Glazed Doughnuts Recipe</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>Prepare the dough. The dough comes together with a mixer. You can also make the dough by hand, but it requires a bit of arm muscle.</li>
            <li>Let the dough rise. In a relatively warm environment, the dough rises in about 90 minutes.</li>
            <li>Punch down the dough to release the air.</li>
            <li>Roll & cut into doughnuts. Roll the dough out to 1/2 inch thickness. Cut the doughnuts using a 3-3.5 inch doughnut cutter.</li>
            <li>Prepare the oil. Using a heavy-duty pot and an oil thermometer, heat the oil to 375°F (191°C). Place a cooling rack over another baking sheet.</li>
            <li>Fry the doughnuts. Working with 2-3 doughnuts at a time, cook for 1 minute on each side. </li>
            <li>Make the glaze. Dip each warm doughnut into the glaze and coat both sides. After about 20 minutes, the glaze will set.</li>
